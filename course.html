          <p>Front-end web design is a developer skill that I was not comfortable enough with. This summer course
            is a great oppurtunity to earn credits and learn new useful skills.
            I have some experience in web development from past courses at CSUF, specifically, using html,javascrip,css and mysql but would like to explore frameworks and using API's.
            I look forward to getting the basics of web development down and building my own website.
