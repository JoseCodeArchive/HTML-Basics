          <p class = "p1">Front-end web design is a developer skill that I did not feel entirely comfortable enough with. This summer course
            is a great oppurtunity to earn credits and learn new useful skills.
          </p>
          <p class = "p2">
            Luckily, I have some experience in web development from working on CS past course projects at CSUF, specifically, using html,javascrip,css and mysql but would like to explore frameworks and using API's.
            I look forward to getting the basics of web development down and building my own website.
